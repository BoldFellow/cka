#------------ Taints------------#

There are three taint effects: NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule, and NoExecute.

NoSchedule:
# This is the strictest effect. It prevents any pod without a matching toleration from being scheduled on the node.

<kubectl taint nodes node1 "key1=value1:NoSchedule"

referNoSchedule:
# This is a "soft" version of NoSchedule. 
# The scheduler will try to avoid placing pods without matching tolerations on this node, but it's not guaranteed.
# If all untainted nodes are fully occupied, pods without matching tolerations may still be scheduled on node2.

<kubectl taint nodes node2 "key2=value2:PreferNoSchedule"

NoExecute:
# This effect not only prevents future scheduling of pods without matching tolerations 
# also evicts any existing pods on the node that don't have matching tolerations.

kubectl taint nodes node3 key3=value3:NoExecute

# View taints on a node
<kubectl describe node <node-name> | grep Taint

# Remove a taint from a node
<kubectl taint nodes <node-name> "key:NoSchedule"- # the - removes the taint.


#------------ Tolerations------------#

There are two main operators used in tolerations: "Equal" and "Exists".

Equal Operator:
# Requires that the key, value, and effect match exactly.

Exists Operator:
# Checks for the existence of the key, regardless of its value.


# is added under the sepc

<tolerations:
      - key: "key-name"
        operator: "Equal/Exists"
        value: "value-name"
        effect: "NoSchedule/PreferNoSchedule/NoExecute">

# to check for tolerations in a deploy
<kubectl describe deploy <deploy-name> | grep Tolerations
