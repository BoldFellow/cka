# Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)

PVCs are requests for storage by a user. They consume PV resources and can request specific sizes and access modes.

<Characteristics:

- Namespaced resources
- Act as a request for storage
- Can be used as volume in pod specifications

<Important-Fields:

<accessModes>: Desired access mode (should match or be a subset of the PV's access modes)
<resources>: Specifies the desired storage size
<storageClassName>: Name of the StorageClass to use for provisioning
<selector>: Can be used to select a specific PV based on labels

# 1. Basic PVC - General use
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: basic-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
  storageClassName: standard

 <!-- Simple PVC requesting 5Gi of storage with ReadWriteOnce access mode.
 Uses the 'standard' storage class, which is often the default in many clusters. -->

---
# 2. PVC with specific storage class
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: fast-storage-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: fast-ssd

<!-- Requests 10Gi of fast SSD storage.
Useful when you need to specify performance characteristics of the storage. -->

---
# 3. PVC for shared access (ReadWriteMany)
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: shared-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
  storageClassName: nfs

<!-- Requests 5Gi of storage that can be accessed by multiple nodes simultaneously.
Uses 'nfs' storage class, suitable for shared file systems. -->

---
# 4. PVC with selector
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: selective-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 8Gi
  storageClassName: ""
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      environment: production

<!-- Uses a selector to bind to a specific PV based on labels.
StorageClassName is set to "" to disable dynamic provisioning.
Useful when you need to claim a specific pre-provisioned PV. -->

---
# 5. PVC for block device
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: block-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  volumeMode: Block
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: block-storage

<!-- Requests a 10Gi block device.
Uses volumeMode: Block for applications that need raw block device access. -->

---
# 6. PVC with expanded capacity
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: expandable-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi
  storageClassName: expandable-storage

<!-- Requests 20Gi of storage.
Uses a storage class that allows volume expansion.
Useful when you anticipate needing to increase the volume size in the future. -->
